# 🎮 Number Guessing Game (Java)

A simple console-based number guessing game built using Java. The user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain number of attempts. It's a great beginner-level project to practice Java fundamentals such as conditionals, loops, input handling, and random number generation.
